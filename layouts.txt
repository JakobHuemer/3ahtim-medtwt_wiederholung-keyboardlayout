The QWERTY Keyboard Layout
A full view of QWERTY keyboard layout

The QWERTY layout has been in use for more than a century now. It is the most widely used keyboard layout and can be found virtually on every typewriter and computer keyboard around the globe. The layout's design intends to facilitate the typing of English text; this works by placing the most commonly used letters in the most accessible positions.

The QWERTY layout is arranged in a grid of four rows and ten columns. The first row contains the letters Q, W, E, R, T, and Y, giving the layout its name. The second row has the letters A, S, D, F, and G in it. The letters Z, X, C, V, and B are in the third row. The bottom row contains the space bar, the shift key, the control key, and the function key.

The QWERTY keyboard layout was developed in the 1870s by a newspaper editor and inventor named Christopher Sholes. Sholes wanted to design it so that the keys don't get jammed when pressed in succession or quickly; he achieved this by placing the most commonly used keys, such as E and T, far apart to prevent the typewriter's mechanical arms from colliding. The QWERTY layout also separates the pairs of most commonly typed letters, such as S and A, to further reduce the likelihood of jamming. This layout quickly became the standard keyboard design for typewriters and carried over to computers when they were invented in the 1960s.

Criticism surrounding the QWERTY layout
Picture showing an evaluation icon

The QWERTY layout is criticized for being inefficient and difficult to learn. Some experts argue that other keyboard layouts, such as the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard (DSK), are more efficient because the most commonly used keys are placed in the center row in this layout, making them easier to access. Despite these criticisms, the QWERTY layout has continued to persist as the standard keyboard layout, mainly due to its widespread acceptance and familiarity. Many people have already invested significant time and effort into learning how to type on a QWERTY keyboard, and they may not want to switch to a different layout. Additionally, the QWERTY keyboard has been embedded in our lives and has even been the subject of academic studies and popular media.
Advantages and Disadvantages of QWERTY Layout

The QWERTY layout has been in use for over a century and is the world's most widely used keyboard layout. It has some disadvantages along with its advantages:
Advantages of QWERTY layout
Picture showing the word "advantage" written on a material

One of the primary advantages of the QWERTY layout is its widespread adoption and familiarity. It is being used in schools, offices, and homes around the globe. This familiarity can make typing on a QWERTY keyboard more efficient for many people.

The QWERTY layout is designed to place the most commonly used letters in the most accessible positions. This makes it easier for people to type accurately and quickly, reducing the likelihood of typewriter jams. Additionally, the most commonly used letters are placed on the home row in a QWERTY layout, reducing hand movement and typing fatigue.

Compatibility is also a huge benefit. The QWERTY layout is universally compatible with virtually any computer or device. This means people can use the QWERTY layout keyboard with any computer or device without ever worrying about compatibility issues.
Disadvantages of QWERTY layout:

As widespread as its reach is, the QWERTY layout is not the most efficient keyboard layout. This layout was designed to prevent typewriter jams, not to optimize typing speed and efficiency. That's why the QWERTY layout may not be the best option for people who type frequently and for long periods.

Being familiar with touch typing is crucial if one wants to use the QWERTY layout keyboard without facing any challenges. The placement of the keys can make it difficult to find the correct keys quickly, and the large size of the keyboard can be intimidating for users, especially beginners.

The QWERTY layout can contribute to repetitive strain injuries RSIs, especially if one doesn't have a proper typing posture and doesn't use touch typing. Frequent hand movement is required to work on a QWERTY layout, causing strain and stress on the wrists, fingers, and forearms. It can be particularly problematic for people who type for extended periods.

In light of these advantages and disadvantages, the best keyboard layout for an individual will depend on their typing needs and preferences. No need to worry if you are not comfortable using the QWERTY keyboard layout; there are alternative layouts as well.
Alternative Keyboard Layouts

The arrangement of keys in a different way than the QWERTY layout to optimize speed and efficiency is an alternative keyboard layout. As discussed earlier, the QWERTY layout is the most commonly used keyboard layout, but over the years, many alternative keyboard layouts have also been developed to address the limitations of the QWERTY layout.
Alternative keyboard layouts: history & development

Alternative keyboard layouts are designed to increase typing efficiency and speed by re-arranging the keys on the keyboard. These alternate layouts work by re-arranging the keys to place the most frequently used keys in the most accessible positions, reducing the amount of hand movement required and increasing typing speed.

August Dvorak developed the first alternative keyboard layout in the 1930s. He did this by analyzing the frequency of letter usage and designing a layout that would place all the most frequently used letters in the home row, reducing hand movement and increasing typing speed. Since then, several different alternative keyboard layouts have been developed, including Colemak, Workman, and Norman.
Difference between QWERTY and alternative keyboard
Picture showing the side by side difference between QWERTY, DVORAK, and COLEMAK keyboard layout

There are several differences between the QWERTY and Alternative keyboard layouts;

The QWERTY layout has the most frequently used letters placed in the upper left corner, which requires more hand movement to access them. In contrast, alternative layouts, such as Dvorak and Colemak, place the most frequently used letters in the home row, reducing hand movement and increasing typing speed.

The QWERTY layout requires the usage of weaker fingers, such as the pinky finger, for commonly used letters like "Q" and "Z." Alternative keyboard layouts, such as Dvorak and Colemak, place these letters in more accessible positions, reducing strain on the weaker fingers and increasing typing speed.

Most people learn to type on a QWERTY keyboard layout. In contrast, a learning curve is required for alternative keyboard layouts as people need to retrain their muscle memory to use a different keyboard layout.

QWERTY layout keyboards are universally adopted and supported; one doesn't have to worry about compatibility. In contrast, alternative keyboard layouts are less widely adopted, which can cause some compatibility issues.

Alternative keyboard layouts are designed to be more effective than the QWERTY layout. Studies have shown that alternative keyboard layouts can help increase typing speed and efficiency and can help reduce typing errors. On the other hand, QWERTY keyboard layouts were designed to prevent typewriter jams, not to optimize speed and accuracy.

There are many alternative keyboard layout options available in the market. Some are popular, others not so much. Let's take a look at the most famous/popular alternative keyboard layouts.
Alternative keyboard layouts: Dvorak and Colemak

Dvorak and Colemak are two well-known alternative keyboard layouts that have gained popularity among users looking for faster and more ergonomic typing experiences.
DVORAK keyboard layout

The Dvorak keyboard layout was developed to create a layout that would minimize finger movement and maximize typing efficiency. It was developed in the 1930s by August Dvorak and William Dealey. The layout is designed to place the most commonly used letters in the home row, reducing the need to reach for letters in the upper row. Frequently used letter combinations, such as "th" and "ed," are placed on adjacent keys, making it easier to type them quickly. Additionally, Dvorak emphasizes the use of the stronger fingers, like the index and middle fingers, and reduces the use of weaker fingers, like the pinky finger. Studies have proved that the Dvorak keyboard layout can increase typing speed and efficiency compared to the QWERTY keyboard layout.

Colemak is another quite popular alternative keyboard layout developed in 2006 by Shai Coleman. Like Dvorak, Colemak is designed to maximize typing efficiency and reduce fatigue while typing. This layout places the most commonly used letters in the home row, with the most common letters, such as "e" and "a," placed under the strongest fingers. Colemak also makes it easier to type the most frequently used letter combinations, such as "th" and "st," by placing them on adjacent keys. The layout is designed to minimize finger movement and reduce strain on fingers and wrists, making it a popular choice among users who suffer from repetitive strain injuries (RSIs). Similar to Dvorak, studies have shown that Colemak can improve typing speed and efficiency compared to the QWERTY layout.

Editor's Note: [As a COLEMAK keyboard fan, you can get this here at a cheap price. You can also choose different options by browsing there.]

The primary advantage of both Dvorak and Colemak keyboard layouts is that both can help reduce strain and fatigue and can help increase typing speed and efficiency compared to the QWERTY layout. The one disadvantage for both Dvorak and Colemak is that they are not widely adopted and can bring forth some compatibility issues, unlike the QWERTY keyboard layout. Furthermore, both layouts require a learning curve as users must retrain their muscle memory to use a different layout.
Advantages of Alternative Keyboard Layouts

Alternative keyboard layouts, such as Dvorak and Colemak, are designed to reduce finger movement and increase typing speed and efficiency while reducing the risk of repetitive strain injuries.

Alternative layouts can reduce discomfort and strain on fingers, hands, and wrists as they require fewer finger movements and use stronger fingers more frequently. This can be beneficial for users who suffer from repetitive strain injuries (RSIs).

Some users may prefer alternative keyboard layouts due to their previous positive experiences. These layouts can provide a more satisfying typing experience and boost confidence in typing abilities.

Users can develop muscle memory over time when adapting to a new keyboard layout, overcoming the learning curve. This can make typing feel more natural and automatic.

Alternative keyboard layouts can be more inclusive for users with physical limitations/disabilities, allowing them to type easily and efficiently.
Disadvantages of Alternative Keyboard Layouts

Alternative keyboard layouts may not be as widely supported as the QWERTY keyboard layout, making it hard to find compatible hardware and software.

One can always consider online resources and typing tutors to help improve their typing speed and accuracy.

Finally, it is of utmost importance that users must always be mindful of their posture and positioning when using virtual or touchscreen keyboards. They should aim to keep their arms comfortable and ergonomic to avoid strain and injury.
The Future of Keyboard Design

We have come a long way since the days of the QWERTY layout, and as technology keeps evolving, so does the design of our keyboards. One of the biggest trends in keyboard design today is the move towards a more compact and portable design. Users are looking for keyboards that are lightweight and easy to carry around. This has led to the development of a range of innovative designs, including foldable and rollable keyboards, as well as keyboards that can be split in half for a more ergonomic typing experience.

The incorporation of new technologies such as touchpads, touchscreens, and haptic feedback has also increased. These technologies help enhance the user experience and make it easier for users to interact with their devices.

With the continuous advancements in technology, new keyboard layouts are continuously being designed to meet the user's needs. Some designers are experimenting with circular keyboards that can be more efficient and ergonomic than traditional rectangular keyboards. Furthermore, some layouts are specifically designed to be used with virtual reality or augmented reality devices, which require different input methods than traditional keyboards.
Keyboard Layouts and Different Languages

Different Keyboard layouts have a significant impact on how people type in different languages. Keyboard layouts have to be able to adapt to meet the different typing styles of each language. Language-specific layouts and adaptations have been developed to make typing more comfortable and efficient for speakers of those languages. Multilingual typing has also become more common, and switching between layouts has become easier thanks to the advancement in technology.

Different languages require different approaches to typing due to the variations in the alphabet systems, grammatical rules, and frequency of certain letters and characters. For instance, the Latin-based alphabet used for English includes 26 letters, while other languages, such as Russian, have 33 letters in their alphabet. Typing in a language with more alphabets requires a larger keyboard, which may not be practical for smaller devices such as smartphones. Moreover, different languages require different typing styles. For example, the English language is written from left to right, while languages such as Arabic and Hebrew are written from right to left. A different approach is required to type in these languages, with the letters or characters being input in the opposite order. This makes it important for keyboard layouts to adapt to meet the needs of different languages and writing systems.
Language-specific keyboard layouts
A full view of German language keyboard layout as an example

Language-specific keyboard layouts have been developed to cater to the specific needs of different languages. Characters specific to the language are featured in these layouts and optimized for placement as frequently used characters. For example, the German language has 3 additional characters that are not present in the English language, and their QWERTZ keyboard layout accommodates these letters. Similarly, languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean require a different approach altogether due to their complex writing systems. These languages have adopted input methods that allow users to type using the phonetic sounds of the language or through a system of radicals or characters.

Multilingual typing has become more common with the rise of global communication and the internet. Many people today use multiple languages in their daily lives, either for work or personal communication. Switching between keyboard layouts is time-consuming and can slow down the typing process. However, advancements in technology have made it easier to switch between layouts quickly.

Operating systems such as Windows and macOS allow users to switch between keyboard layouts with a few keystrokes, making it easier to switch between languages. On mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, users can switch between layouts by using downloading third-party keyboard apps. These apps provide users with the ability to switch between multiple keyboard layouts and even customize the layout to suit their needs.
